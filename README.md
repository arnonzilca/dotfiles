Arnon's dotfiles
================

These are my dotfiles.

I'd recomend cloning to `~/dotfiles`:

	git clone https://github.com/arnonzilca/dotfiles ~/dotfiles

After cloning run `~/dotfiles/install`.
> Please note that while this repository uses submodules it is not mandatory to clone it with '--recursive'.
> The installation script will take care of that for you. :)
